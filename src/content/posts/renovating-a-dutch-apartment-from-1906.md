During COVID-19 (2020 and 2021), my partner and I renovated the top floor of a Rotterdam house built in 1906. We added two 11.5-meter-long dormers to either side of the structure, transforming an A-frame attic apartment into a spacious loft.

# The Renovation Journey

We bought the top two floors of a four-story house at the beginning of COVID-19 and started the renovation in the summer of 2020. We lived in the lower floor for the entire duration of the renovation. The renovation took approximately 1.5 years to complete because we did most of the work ourselves while working full-time jobs. A significant challenge of this project was that the house had settled unevenly. The front (north side) of the house was 14 cm lower than the back, and the east side was 7 cm lower than the west.

## Pre-Construction: Planning and Permits, 6 months 

- Obtained approval from the association of homeowners.
- Secured building permits from the municipality of Rotterdam. This required architectural drawings and structural calculations. Fortunately, my master's degree in structural engineering allowed me to complete these myself.

## Phase 1: Demolition , 4 months


- Stripped interior spaces: Removed interior walls, floors, kitchen, and bathroom.
- Removed three old chimneys, two of which were no longer in use. The third one had a gas and toilet exhaust, which were rerouted until the dormers were installed.

Confident that the permit would be approved, we began interior demolition before receiving official approval.

By the time demolition was complete, we had filled about five 10-cubic-meter dumpsters with debris. We removed the debris in stages. We would demolish sections of the house, creating a pile until it became difficult to manage. Then, we rented a dumpster and a moving lift and enlisted some friends to help us transport the debris to the dumpster using the lift for an hour

Luckily, the dormer was resting on the truss. It was convenient that we could remove this wall before taking out the old dormer.")

![looking at the back wall](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/looking-at-the-back-wall.jpg "We loaded all the building materials in burlap bags and either carried them down four flights of stairs or rented a moving lift to remove them from the front window. Demolition was easy, but getting rid of all the debris felt like much more work. We reused the bags until they became too worn.")

![lowering materials](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/lowering-materials.jpg "This was the house lift we rented for an hour to remove debris. In later phases, we used it to bring materials up. The demolition phase felt never-ending.")

![front facade cleared out](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/front-facade-cleared-out.jpg "It was a great feeling when the space was finally empty!")

### Chimneys

Destroying chimneys was fun! After my partner and I did the first one together, we invited friends over to help with the other two (I took on the glorious task of filling burlap bags with bricks). Here's a breakdown of the chimney removal process:

- Remove the plaster on the interior of the chimney. This makes it significantly easier to remove the bricks.
- Build a platform on the exterior to stand on while destroying the top of the chimney.
- Take the chimney apart brick by brick with a hammer and chisel. Once you get going, a light tap with the hammer should be enough to loosen the bricks so you can remove them by hand.
- Stuff towels in the chimney holes to prevent debris from falling into them.
- Once the chimney is destroyed, create a temporary waterproof cover for the hole in the roof where the chimney served as an exhaust. Expandable foam is your friend for closing any gaps.
- Add new supports and subflooring where the chimney once stood.

## Phase 2: Prepare back facade, 1 month

This phase involved preparing the back facade for the future dormers and the balcony extension. The goal was to create a full glass back facade with sliding doors opening onto a larger balcony with a partially covered roof. 

- Created a new truss, in place, which would carry the loads from the roof and dormers once the exterior brick wall was removed.
- Demolished the exterior brick wall.
- Built a temporary facade to protect the interior from the elements until the new facade was installed.
- Fixed the flooring where the old brick wall was removed.
- Installed a beam to create the foundation for the future sliding door.

### Truss construction

![truss worksite overview](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/truss-worksite-overview.jpg "In hindsight having the whole space as my private workshop was a luxury, I miss that at times now")

![contemplating truss](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/contemplating-truss.jpg "A lot of thought went into the truss design.")

![drilling holes](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/drilling-holes.jpg "Since the truss was built in place, I sandwiched the rafter and strut together. In theory, this was not necessary because all the load should be transferred through the strut, but this was the geometry the original trusses had, and it would keep the truss together if there was some out-of-plane force.")

![truss roughly assembled](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/truss-roughly-assembled.jpg "Bolted together, but needing final cuts and painting.")

![painting truss](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/painting-truss.jpg "Using boat paint to preserve the wood color (wish we used white - sun exposure is causing graying).")

![installing truss top chord](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/installing-truss-top-chord.jpg "Here, we're doing the final assembly of the truss. The top chord also sandwiched the rafters.")

### Demolishing the back facade

With the truss securely in place, we could now remove the back facade. This was a nerve-wracking moment, as the truss would be solely responsible for supporting the roof.

![beginning facade demolition](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/beginning-facade-demolition.jpg "We began demolition on a rainy day. The large triangle in front of the truss is the new facade wall, we cannibalized the truss template for this.")

![brick facade](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/brick-facade.jpg "Similar to the chimneys, the 25 cm thick brick wall wasn't too difficult to remove after taking out the initial bricks. We were able to break most of it apart by hand.")

![facade gone](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/facade-gone.jpg)

![rotten wood within old wall](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/rotten-wood-within-old-wall.jpg "The demolition process exposed some unexpected deterioration. Over a century of being embedded in the brick wall had caused significant rot in the wooden joists.")

![bags of bricks](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/bags-of-bricks.jpg "In a single day of work, we were able to demolish the entire back facade and bag all the bricks.")

### Fix the flooring

Removing the wall created a new challenge: a gap of 2-8 cm between the steel channels supporting the old mason facade and the subfloor. Since this area would become part of the exterior deck, we needed to fill the gap and ensure proper water drainage.

![steel supporting facade](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/steel-supporting-facade.jpg "The steel channels were heavily rusted, and a significant amount of cleaning was required before we could proceed.")

![plates added sloped floor](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/plates-added-sloped-floor.jpg "With the floor leveled and filled, we added plates to create a slight slope that would direct water runoff away from the new facade." )

![temp facade](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/temp-facade.jpg "As fall approached, known for its rainy weather in the Netherlands, we constructed a temporary facade to protect the workspace from the elements.")

## Phase 3: Dormer Construction, 4 months

The construction of the dormers was the most time-consuming and challenging part of the renovation project. With the roof exposed, our top priority was to get the dormers built and waterproofed as quickly as possible to avoid water damage.  There were a few setbacks, like the time a leaky tarp caused a pool of water to form in the workspace in the middle of the night!  This phase required long days and a lot of dedication. Here's a breakdown of the dormer construction process:

- We built each dormer in stages, finished one dormer then started on the other:
   - Removed all roof tiles from the dormer installation areas on both sides of the A-frame roof.
   - Removed sections of the roof where the fill beams would be installed (two beams per dormer, front and back).
   - Fabricated and installed the fill beams on the front and back sides of each dormer. 
   - Demolished the remaining roof sections to make way for the dormer structures.
   - Installed the framing for the dormer walls and ceiling.
   - Used 18-mm multiplex for the dormer walls, chosen for its ability to withstand lateral wind loads.
   - Constructed parquet: according to our permit, this needed to be the same height as our neighbor’s dormer. Because our house was not level, but our neighbors were, the parquet on our roof did not have a uniform height.
   - Install battens, water barrier, and exterior cladding.
   - Waterproofed the roof and parapets using bitumen and flashing materials.
- Install Tyvek on the roof ridge.
- Reinstall roof tiles: This required extensive cutting of tiles to fit around the dormers.
- Reroute the exhausts for the water heaters

### Fabrication and installation of fill beams

### Dormer fabrication

![removing roof](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/removing-roof.jpg "The first step was removing a section of the roof to expose the old dormer frame. This wasn't ideal weather-wise, but we wanted to keep the project moving.")

## Fix back facade (Phase 4, 1 month)

With the dormers installed we could now continue work on the back facade.

- Constructed the frame for the sliding glass doors
- Installed bitumen on the new balcony floor
- Replaced all rotten wood
- Constructed a new wooden deck for the balcony
- Installed sliding glass doors

![figuring out where to install door frame](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/figuring-out-where-to-install-door-frame.jpg " We used a laser level to ensure accurate placement for the top of the sliding door frame.")

So for small projects like this we'd get material that we could carry ourselves and save the costs of the lift.")

Here we're a bit out of order with the photos we were on our way with interior construction when the doors and windows arrived.")

## Interior Construction (Phase 5, 6 months)

The last leg of this project was probably also the most work. We outsourced plumbing, floor heating, plastering, installing the parquet floor and installing the kitchen counter tops. There are too many tasks to list like I did above so I've picked a few highlights and tried to show the process for each.

![phase 3 dormer complete](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/phase-3-dormer-complete.jpg "Since the start of the construction I couldn't wait for the moment to clean the trusses and bring them back to their natural color. I was so excited, I started sanding the trusses long before I should have.")

### Bookcase

![framing bookcase](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/framing-bookcase.jpg "The exhaust from our neighbors water heater and some bathroom fans went through our ceiling. Rather than having just a mechanical box we decided to build a bookcase around it.")

![painted bookcase](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/painted-bookcase.jpg "We added wooden shelves after the bookcase was plastered")

### Kitchen

We went for an Ikea kitchen with a composite counter top from a different supplier. We made the kitchen counter earth level (because we also had the concept of 'house level' due to the slope of the house) and 83cm tall at the center of the kitchen. Which meant that on the east side of the house the counter was 86cm tall and on the west side it was 80cm tall.

Everything was covered in a vapor barrier. I'm really happy with the warmth of space, in below freezing nights it can be warm upstairs with only the floor heating.")

We used [plaatprikker](https://www.plaatprikker.com/) to easily mark where we had to drill the holes for the outlets. There are pretty expensive for what they are but save so much time it's worth the cost.")

### Skylights

We added 4 [Velux skylights](https://www.velux.nl/) at the ridge, which really lightened up the space. Sometimes I wear sunglasses upstairs. If I were going to re-do this project, I would spend the extra money to have exterior shades on the skylights It can get really hot in the summer.

![skylights on ceiling](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/skylights-on-ceiling.jpg "I started by framing where the skylights would be attached to, then drilled a hole through the interior corner of each frame. So I would know where to cut out the outside.")

### Mechanical shaft, toilet, and closet

We wanted to have a toilet upstairs and needed a mechanical shaft for our water heater and bathroom exhaust as well as a place for the floor heating pump and tubes. Therefore, we sandwiched the mechanical shaft between the toilet and the closet.

Here, we are cutting out two parts from the brick wall that will support the floor joists to be installed.")

### Finalizing the space

Once all the walls were built, the MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) systems were installed. Then, the walls were covered (drywall most likely). A separate company plastered the space. After that, we painted everything, and another company installed the floor heating. Unfortunately, the floor wasn't level enough to lay the parquet flooring directly on the Femerell plates. To address this, we had to level the floor before the parquet could be installed. Finally, the project was complete, and we could enjoy the finished space.
