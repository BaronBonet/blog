During Covid (2020 and 2021) my partner and I renovated the top floor of a Rotterdam house build in 1906. We added two 11.5 meter long dormers to either side of the structure transforming a A-frame attic apartment into a spacious loft.

## The Renovation Journey

We bought the top two floors of a 4 story house at the start of Covid and started the renovation in the summer of 2020. We lived in the lower level during the entirety of the renovation. The renovation took approximately 1.5 years to complete since we did most of the work ourselves and were working full time.

### Pre-Construction: Planning and Permits, 6 months 

- Obtain approval from the VVE. The VVE is the association of owners of the building. We had to present our plans to the VVE and obtain their approval.
- Secured building permits from the municipality of Rotterdam. This required architectural drawings and structural calculations. Luckily I have a bachelors in architectural engineering and a masters in structural engineering so I was able to do this myself.

### Phase 1: Demolition , 4 months

We were quite confident the permit would be approved so we started interior demolition prior to approval.

- Stripped the interior spaces: Removed kitchen, bathroom existing walls and floors.
- Removed three old chimneys: Two of which were not in use one had gas and toilet exhaust which were rerouted until dormers were installed.

By the time demolition was complete we used about five 10m{{<super "3">}} dumpsters to remove all the debris. We did this in stages, destroy parts of the house and make a pile of debris in the space until it became difficult to continue, then rent a dumpster and a moving lift and get some friends to help for an hour ferrying the debris to the dumpster with the lift. Luckily for us due to Covid we had a lot of friends with time on their hands.

We started with a few basic tools that I had from my university days in America then slowly purchased more, remembering how we hammered all these tiles out we would have made life a lot easier if we got a hammer drill earlier.

We would load all the building material in these burlap bags and either take them down 4 flights of stairs or hire a moving lift and remove them from the front window. Destroying things was the easy part, getting all the debris into the dumpster felt like much more work. We would reuse the bags until they got too many holes in them.

![lowering materials](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/lowering-materials.jpg "This was the house lift we'd rent for an hour to get the debris out. In the later phases we'd use this to get materials up to which we were really excited about. It felt like the demolition phase was never ending.")

#### Chimneys
Destroying chimneys was fun, after my partner and I did the 1st one together then we invited friends over to do the other two (I took the wonderful task of filling the burlap bags with bricks). The process for removing a chimney was roughly:
- Remove the plaster on the interior of the chimney, this makes it significantly easier to remove the bricks on the interior.
- Build a platform on the exterior to stand on while destroying the top of the chimney.
- Take the chimney apart brick by brick with a hammer and chisel.  Once you going going you could give the bricks a lite tap and they'd be loose enough to remove by hand.
  - Stuff towels in the chimney holes to prevent debris from falling into them.
- Once the chimney is destroyed make a temporary waterproof cover for the hole in the roof where the chimney was used as an exhaust, expandable foam is your friend to close the gaps.

### Prepare back facade (Phase 2, 1 month)

The back of the house was going to be all glass with sliding doors to the balcony. The length of the balcony was also going to be increased and partially covered by the roof.

- Created a new truss which would support the roof and dormers once the exterior brick wall was removed.
- Demolished the exterior brick wall
- Build a temporary facade to protect the interior from the elements until the new facade was installed.
- Fix flooring where the old brick wall was removed.
- Install beam that will create foundation for the sliding door

### Dormer Construction (Phase 3, 4 months)

We did this in winter which made the process a bit more difficult because it rained so much. We had to cover the roof with a tarp and work under it until the structure was ready for waterproofing. I took one week off for each dormer and worked very long days.

- Built each dormer in stages:
  - Remove all roof tiles for that side of the A-frame
  - demolished one side
  - constructed structural wooden elements for dormer extension and multiplex ceiling and walls
  - construct parquet: according to our permit this needed to be the same height as our neighbors dormer. Because our house was not level, but our neighbors was, the parquet on our roof did not have a uniform height.
  - Install battens, water barrier and exterior cladding
  - waterproofed the roof and parquet with bitumen and flashing.
- Install Tyvek on the roof ridge, battens
- Reinstall roof tiles: This required a lot of cutting of tiles to fit around the dormers.

### Interior Construction (Phase 4, 6 months)

- Insulated the floor: Installed 3cm of Fermacell insulation for improved thermal performance.
- Exposed and treated existing beams: Sanded the trusses and beams for an aesthetic touch.
- Framed interior and exterior walls: Created the new living space layout.
- Installed electrical and plumbing systems: Essential infrastructure for a functional living space.
- Added interior insulation and vapor barrier: Ensured energy efficiency and prevented moisture build-up.
- Finished walls: Installed OSB, drywall, and plaster for a smooth finish.
- Installed floor heating: Added a comfortable and modern heating system.
- Leveled the floor: Used self-leveling concrete for a perfect base.
- Completed painting and trim: Applied caulk, painted walls and ceilings, and installed skirting boards.

### Final Touches (Phase 5, 2 months)

- Assembled the Ikea kitchen: Completed the heart of the home.
- Tiled the bathroom: Installed the toilet and other bathroom fixtures.
- Installed parquet flooring: Added a beautiful and durable flooring material.
- Installed kitchen appliances and countertops: Finalized the kitchen for functionality and aesthetics.

Installed dormer cladding and skylights: Completed the dormer exteriors and added natural light to the upper floor.
Repaired the main roof: Fixed waterproofing at the peak, reinstalled roof tiles, and replaced rotten wood.
