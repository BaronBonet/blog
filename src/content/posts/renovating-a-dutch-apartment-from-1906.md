During Covid (2020 and 2021) my partner and I renovated the top floor of a Rotterdam house build in 1906. We added two 11.5 meter long dormers to either side of the structure transforming a A-frame attic apartment into a spacious loft.

# The Renovation Journey

My partner and I bought the top two floors of a 4 story house at the start of Covid and started the renovation in the summer of 2020. We lived in the lower level during the entirety of the renovation. The renovation took approximately 1.5 years to complete since we did most of the work ourselves and were working full time. One notable detail that made this project challenging was the concept of "house level" the house had settled so the front (north side) of the house was 14cm lower than the back and the west side was 7cm higher than the east.

## Pre-Construction: Planning and Permits, 6 months 

- Obtain approval from the VVE. The VVE is the association of owners of the building. We had to present our plans to the VVE and obtain their approval.
- Secured building permits from the municipality of Rotterdam. This required architectural drawings and structural calculations. Luckily I have a bachelors in architectural engineering and a masters in structural engineering so I was able to do this myself.

## Phase 1: Demolition , 4 months

We were quite confident the permit would be approved so we started interior demolition prior to approval.

- Stripped the interior spaces: Removed kitchen, bathroom existing walls and floors.
- Removed three old chimneys: Two of which were not in use one had gas and toilet exhaust which were rerouted until dormers were installed.

By the time demolition was complete we used about five 10m{{<super "3">}} dumpsters to remove all the debris. We did this in stages, destroy parts of the house and make a pile of debris in the space until it became difficult to continue, then rent a dumpster and a moving lift and get some friends to help for an hour ferrying the debris to the dumpster with the lift. Luckily for us due to Covid we had a lot of friends with time on their hands.

![removing flooring](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/removing-flooring.jpg "Kitchen was all out and started to remove the floor")
![destroying shower](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/destroying-shower.jpg "Destroying the bathroom")
![removing tiles](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/removing-tiles.jpg "Removing the tiles with a chisel, we really tested the patience of our neighbors at times.")
We started with a few basic tools that I had from my university days in America then slowly purchased more, remembering how we hammered all these tiles out we would have made life a lot easier if we got a hammer drill earlier.

![looking at the back wall](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/looking-at-the-back-wall.jpg "facing the back wall, looking at these photos I'm embarrassed how messy it got")

We would load all the building material in these burlap bags and either take them down 4 flights of stairs or hire a moving lift and remove them from the front window. Destroying things was the easy part, getting all the debris into the dumpster felt like much more work. We would reuse the bags until they got too many holes in them.

![lowering materials](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/lowering-materials.jpg "This was the house lift we'd rent for an hour to get the debris out. In the later phases we'd use this to get materials up to which we were really excited about. It felt like the demolition phase was never ending.")

![loaded dumpster](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/loaded-dumpster.jpg "A full dumpster, after this one we either had brick only dumpsters, which were significantly cheaper or closed dumpsters with a lock. Neighbors would use our dumpster even if we had it covered.")

![front facade cleared out](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/front-facade-cleared-out.jpg "it was a great feeling when the space was finally empty")

### Chimneys
Destroying chimneys was fun, after my partner and I did the 1st one together then we invited friends over to do the other two (I took the wonderful task of filling the burlap bags with bricks). The process for removing a chimney was roughly:
- Remove the plaster on the interior of the chimney, this makes it significantly easier to remove the bricks on the interior.
- Build a platform on the exterior to stand on while destroying the top of the chimney.
- Take the chimney apart brick by brick with a hammer and chisel.  Once you going going you could give the bricks a lite tap and they'd be loose enough to remove by hand.
  - Stuff towels in the chimney holes to prevent debris from falling into them.
- Once the chimney is destroyed make a temporary waterproof cover for the hole in the roof where the chimney was used as an exhaust, expandable foam is your friend to close the gaps.

![creating supports where old chimneys were](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/creating-supports-where-old-chimneys-were.jpg "We would eventually have flooring where the chimney was, so that required some new supports")

## Prepare back facade (Phase 2, 1 month)

The back of the house was going to be all glass with sliding doors to the balcony. The length of the balcony was also going to be increased and partially covered by the roof.

- Created a new truss in place which would carry the loads from the roof and dormers once the exterior brick wall was removed.
- Demolished the exterior brick wall
- Build a temporary facade to protect the interior from the elements until the new facade was installed.
- Fix flooring where the old brick wall was removed.
- Install beam that will create foundation for the sliding door
- Put bitumen on the new balcony floor.

![brick wall removing plaster](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/brick-wall-removing-plaster.jpg "we removed the plaster before the truss was installed because it much easier to destroy the wally when the plaster is already off. We also got some wood to fix all the holes in the floor.")

### The truss

![truss wood on site](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/truss-wood-on-site.jpg "bringing the wood up felt like a major milestone, before this we were only getting stuff out of the space.")

![fabricating truss](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/fabricating-truss.jpg "fabrication where the top of the rafters met")

![chipping away at truss](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/chipping-away-at-truss.jpg "started by making cuts with the chop saw at a set depth, then remove all the left over pieces, and chisel and sand the rest")

![truss-test-piece](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/truss-test-piece.jpg "my first attempt at fabricating the rafter didn't work I ended up using that as a template moving forward")

![truss worksite overview](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/truss-worksite-overview.jpg "in hindsight having the whole space as my private workshop was a luxury, I miss that at times now")

![contemplating truss](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/contemplating-truss.jpg "I spent a lot of time thinking about the truss...")

![drilling holes](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/drilling-holes.jpg "Since the truss was built in place I sandwiched the rafter and strut together. In theory this wasn't necessary since all the load should be transferred through the strut but this was the geometry the original trusses had and it would keep the structure together if there was some out-of-plane force")

![truss roughly assembled](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/truss-roughly-assembled.jpg "the truss was bolted together but we still had to make the final cuts to all the horizontal elements and paint them")

![painting truss](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/painting-truss.jpg "We painted the truss with a boat lack because we wanted to keep the wood color, In hindsight we should have painted it white right away the parts of the truss facing the sun are now greying, we're probably going to sand and re-paint it this summer")

![installing truss top chord](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/installing-truss-top-chord.jpg "Here we're doing the final assembly of the truss. The top chord, also sandwiched the rafters, I wanted to make a mortise and tenon joint but I don't think it would have been possible to install the truss with the roof still in place.")

### Demolishing the back facade

With the truss in place the next step as to destroy the back facade. Then I'd put my engineering to the test because with the facade gone the truss would be holding the roof up.

![beginning facade demolition](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/beginning-facade-demolition.jpg "We started demolishing the facade as it was raining out. The oversized triangle in front of the truss would be the new facade wall. We cannibalized the truss template for this.")

![brick facade](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/brick-facade.jpg "the wall was 25cm thick, but just like the chimneys once the first few bricks were removed the wall could be picked apart by hand")

![facade gone](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/facade-gone.jpg)

![rotten wood within old wall](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/rotten-wood-within-old-wall.jpg "For more than 100 years the wood on the joists was embedded in the brick wall, much of this wood turned to powder when the wall was removed.")

![bags of bricks](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/bags-of-bricks.jpg "In one days worth of work we destroyed the entire back facade and bagged all the bricks, It was late and I was exhausted in this photo")


### Fix flooring

Removing the wall created some new issues, the mason wall was resting on 2 steel steel channels that formed an I profile there was a 2-8cm gap between the steel channels and the sub floor, this had to be filled in, then because this part of the deck was outside we needed to ensure everything sloped towards the drain.

![steel supporting facade](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/steel-supporting-facade.jpg "these channels were extremely rusted i think i removed kilos of rust from the top flange")

![leveling floor](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/leveling-floor.jpg)

![leveling material](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/leveling-material.jpg "we used a small aggregate to ensure the 18mm plywood that would form the sub flooring of the deck was fully supported")

![plates added sloped floor](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/plates-added-sloped-floor.jpg "with the floor in place the next step would be replacing all the bitumen and adding the deck." )

![temp facade](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/temp-facade.jpg "we were heading into fall which is one of the many rainy seasons  in Holland, so we made a temp facade to keep the workspace dry.")

## Dormer Construction (Phase 3, 4 months)

The construction of the Dormers was the most time intensive part of the project. Once the roof was removed we had to get the structure up and waterproofed fast. I recall waking up one night to the sound of dripping only to run upstairs and discover a pool of water in the workshop, because one of the tarps had a leek. I took one week off for each dormer and worked very long days the rough process for this was:

- Built each dormer in stages:
  - Remove all roof tiles for that side of the A-frame and remove the part of the roof where the fill beam would be installed, two per dormer on either end.
  - Fabricate and install the fill beams on the front and back of the dormer.
  - demolished the roof
  - install the framing and multiplex walls and ceiling. We used 18mm multiplex for the walls which also server to withstand the lateral loads from wind
  - construct parquet: according to our permit this needed to be the same height as our neighbors dormer. Because our house was not level, but our neighbors was, the parquet on our roof did not have a uniform height.
  - Install battens, water barrier and exterior cladding
  - waterproofed the roof and parquet with bitumen and flashing.
- Install Tyvek on the roof ridge, battens
- Reinstall roof tiles: This required a lot of cutting of tiles to fit around the dormers.
- Re-route the exhausts for the water heaters

### Fabricating and installing fill beams

![supporting joist](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/supporting-joist.jpg "Installed a temporary column to support the joist before the fill beam was installed.")
![fabricating joist](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/fabricating-joist.jpg "We decided to use a type of a lap joint...honestly not sure what the official name of the joint was. My friend Arpad, who's also a structural engineer came over to help figure out how to make it work.")

### Dormer fabrication

![installing roof](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/installing-roof.jpg "For the 1st dormer we used OSB for the roof which was a mistake, it's cheaper than multiplex but the tongue and groove didn't fit together well and it was a pain to get the pieces to fit snug.")

![temporary waterproofing](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/temporary-waterproofing.jpg "The roof was like this for a week and it created a lot of headache because as best I tried I couldn't keep all the water out. Luckily the roof was 'house level' so water naturally went to the corner where we'd install the drain.")

## Fix back facade (Phase 4, 1 month)

- Construct the frame for the sliding glass doors
- Install bitumen on the new balcony floor.
- The parts of the joist which was in contact with the mason wall and the entire fascia board (boeiboord in Dutch) needed replacement.
- Construct a new wooden deck for the balcony
- Install sliding glass doors

## Interior Construction (Phase 5, 6 months)

- Sanding trusses
- Insulated the floor: Installed 3cm of Fermacell insulation for improved thermal performance.
- Exposed and treated existing beams: Sanded the trusses and beams for an aesthetic touch.
- Framed interior and exterior walls: Created the new living space layout.
- Installed electrical and plumbing systems: Essential infrastructure for a functional living space.
- Added interior insulation and vapor barrier: Ensured energy efficiency and prevented moisture build-up.
- Finished walls: Installed OSB, drywall, and plaster for a smooth finish.
- Installed floor heating: Added a comfortable and modern heating system.
- Leveled the floor: Used self-leveling concrete for a perfect base.
- Completed painting and trim: Applied caulk, painted walls and ceilings, and installed skirting boards.

![phase 3 dormer complete](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/phase-3-dormer-complete.jpg "Since the start of the construction I couldn't wait for the moment to clean the trusses and bring them back to their natural color. I was so excited I started sanding them long before we should have.")

### Kitchen

We went for an Ikea kitchen with a composite counter top from a different supplier. We made the kitchen counter earth level (because we also had the concept of 'house level') and 83cm tall at the center of the kitchen. Which meant east side of the house the counter was 86cm tall and on the west side it was 80cm tall.

![kitchen framing into wall](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/kitchen-framing-into-wall.jpg "We wanted to use as much space as possible so we made it so the cabinets went deeper than the counter.")

![kitchen adding vapor barrier](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/kitchen-adding-vapor-barrier.jpg "We used rockwool insulation on the walls and a hard polyurethane foam on the ceiling. Everything was covered in a vapor barrier. I'm really happy with the warmth of space, in below freezing nights it can be warm upstairs with only the floor heating.")

We used [plaatprikker](https://www.plaatprikker.com/) to easily mark where we had to drill the holes for the outlets. There are pretty expensive for what they are but save so much time it's worth the cost.")

### Skylights

We added 4 [Velux skylights](https://www.velux.nl/) at the ridge which really lightened up the space. Sometimes I wear sunglasses upstairs. If I was going to re-do this project I'd spend the extra money to have exterior shades on the skylights It can get really hot in the summer.

![skylights on ceiling](https://cdn.ericcbonet.com/rotterdam-renovation/skylights-on-ceiling.jpg "I started by framing where the skylights would be attached to, then drilled a hole through the interior corner of each frame. So I would know where to cut out the outside.")

### Mechanical shaft, toilet and closet
We wanted to have a toilet upstairs and needed a mechanical shaft for our water heater and bathroom exhaust as well as a place for the floor heating pump and tubes. So we sandwiched the mechanical shaft between the toilet and closet.

### Finalizing the space
Once all the Walls were built, MEP was installed and walls were covered. A company plaster the space. We then painted everything, another company installed the floor heating. The floor was not smooth enough to lay the parquet flooring directly on the fermecell plates. So equalized the floor, the parquet was installed and we enjoyed.
