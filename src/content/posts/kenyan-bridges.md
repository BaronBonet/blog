# Building foot bridge is rural Kenya

I spent 1.5 years working as the field engineer for a NGO building pedestrian foot bridges in rural Kenya. It was and probably will be the most interesting job I've ever had. Writing this a decade later, I want to talk about how I'm torn if it did any good. The bridges still stand I can imaging as the founder of the NGO always said they did "save lives". But in 30 or so years, after the rivers eroded enough and the towers collapse, or the bride deck corrodes or rots away with no one replacing it. Will the situation in those communities improved. Will the people we employed to help build them have better lives?

If you want to build a foot bridge and you have have the funding to do so, there are three steps:

1. Design
2. Fabricate
3. Construct
